/*
The code will throw an error because the `number` variable is declared as a constant (`const`) and cannot be mutated. Constant variables are read-only and their value cannot be changed once assigned.

If you change the `number` variable declaration from `const` to `let`, then the code will execute without any errors. In that case, the `for` loop will iterate 10 times, adding 5 to the `number` variable on each iteration. As a result, the value of `number` will be 50, since 5 is added 10 times (5 * 10).
